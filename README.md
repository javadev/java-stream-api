# java-stream-api

### Explore and master Java Streams with over 50 practical, real-world examples.

This repository contains concise, commented, and well-structured Java examples that demonstrate how to use the Java Stream API for efficient and modern data processing. Each example focuses on a common data transformation or query operation â€” from filtering and mapping, to advanced grouping and aggregation.

## Features

- **50+ Realistic Examples**  
  Find, filter, map, reduce, group, sort, combine, and transform data using Stream API with intuitive, idiomatic Java code.

- **Educational & Practical**  
  Each example is presented as a separate, easily understandable static method with clear naming and documentation, making it great for learning, interviews, or reference.

- **Covers Core Stream API Use Cases**  
  Including:
  - Filtering and searching
  - Mapping and transforming
  - Distinctness and deduplication
  - Sorting and ordering
  - Reducing, aggregating, and summarizing
  - Working with objects
  - Advanced grouping and partitioning
  - Optional usage and null safety
  - Collectors and downstream collectors

## Example Topics

- Counting, summing, averaging, finding min/max
- Combining and joining strings or lists
- Extracting, flattening, and mapping nested structures
- Grouping and partitioning data
- Generating and processing random data
- Working with custom objects and collections

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo:**  
   `git clone https://github.com/javadev/java-stream-api.git`
2. **Open in your favorite IDE**
3. **Run the main class (`App.java`)** to execute all examples, or call any method independently.

## Who Is This For?

- **Java learners** wishing to deepen practical knowledge  
- **Java developers** needing quick reference or copy-paste solutions  
- **Instructors/interviewers** looking for demonstration snippets  
- **Anyone** exploring the power of functional programming in Java!
